# Produce-Stand

Pretending a produce stand would have a COBOL program to track their transactions. I always wanted to learn and make something dumb with COBOL, so here it is.


## Development with VS Code
- Install VS Code Extensions
  - Zowe Explorer 
  - IBM Z Open Editor
- Setup Zowe profile (Zowe > Unix System Services)
  - name - ```MYPROFILE```
  - z/OS url - ```https://<ip>:<port>```
  - "Accept connections..." - ```false```
  - "API mediation layer..." - ```blank```
  - "Encoding..." - ```blank```
